# Roadmap

Long-term plans and priorities.

## Current Focus
Stabilizing core synth functionality and exploring sound design features.

## Ready to Merge (Feature Branches)
- [ ] `feature/presets` — Factory presets with 6 hand-crafted locations
- [ ] `feature/terrain-intensity` — Intensity slider to tame flat terrain
- [ ] `feature/terrain-stacking` — Play multiple terrain frames simultaneously
- [ ] `feature/unison-oscillators` — Traditional synth unison (detune + stereo)

## Up Next
- [ ] Merge and test feature branches
- [ ] Add stereo width control to reverb section
- [ ] URL sharing (encode location + settings in URL params)
- [ ] Export wavetable as WAV/audio file

## Later
- [ ] Save/load user presets (localStorage)
- [ ] Additional effects (delay, distortion)
- [ ] Higher resolution wavetable options
- [ ] Multi-voice polyphony improvements
- [ ] Pitch bend support

## Icebox
Ideas we're not pursuing now but might revisit:
- Seafloor/bathymetry data (requires different API)
- Mobile-optimized layout
- MIDI CC mapping UI
- Wavetable export to other synth formats
