# Brand System

Design foundation, interaction patterns, and voice guidelines.

> **How to use this:** Start sparse — fill sections as decisions are made. Not everything needs defining upfront. Update when you notice inconsistency or make deliberate choices. This is a living reference, not a spec to complete.
